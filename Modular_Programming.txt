- Modular Programming

	Build small portions of code specific to solve a single problem.
The programmer designs functions and procedures to solve complex problems using
modules. This make the code more readable and feasible.

	This practice allows coding, testing and evaluating of each module
individually. It makes easier to detect bugs and errors. Using the modular
programming, a team can separate modules to each member, thus making the
coding of the whole project faster.

	Every major programming language has a group of modules ready to be
used. These are called language libraries are gather functions previously 
tested and ready to use.


- Functions

	Code of a function is said to be encapsulated inside of it. Below
we have the syntax of a function:

public static DATA_TYPE <FUNCTION_NAME> (PARAMETERS){
	
	CODE
}

 * DATA_TYPE is the type of data that the function will return

	Inside the function variable can be declared but they are bound to
only be local. It is possible to have a function with zero local variables.

	A good practice is to declare constants to fixed data that will be
used indefinitely. By doing this, you will only to change one line of code,
if you desire to change the constant value in your entire code.

 
- Procedures

	They are the same of functions. The only difference is that they do
not return a value. The void data type tells that the procedure will not
return a value.

	the syntax of a procedure:

public static void <PROCEDURE_NAME> (PARAMETERS){
	PROCEDURE BODY
}
