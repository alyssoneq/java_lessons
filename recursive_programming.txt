- RECURSIVE PROGRAMMING

	Recursion stands for the process of repeting something that was
previously shown.

	example of an infinite recursive function:

publica class ProgramRecursion{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println(functionX());
	}

	public static int functionX(){
	return functionX();
	}
}

	An infinite recursive function is a problem to a program. Running
it will make the program crash because the memory allocated to each call
of the function will be greater than the actual memory of the computer.
